# 🚀 Automating EKS Cluster Deployment with Terraform and Jenkins Pipeline

Welcome to the repository for **🚀 Automating EKS Cluster Deployment with Terraform and Jenkins Pipeline**!

## 🌟 Overview
This project covers:
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Terraform to define and manage your EKS cluster.
- **CI/CD Automation**: Leverage Jenkins Pipeline to automate deployments.

## 📋 Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:
- **Jenkins Server**: A running Jenkins instance with necessary plugins installed.
- **Terraform**: Installed on your Jenkins server or agent.
- **AWS Credentials**: Configured in Jenkins using AWS credentials plugin or environment variables.
- **GitHub Repository**: This repository should be connected to your Jenkins project.

## 🛠️ Jenkins Pipeline Setup
### 1. **Install Required Jenkins Plugins**
   - **Terraform Plugin**: To directly use Terraform commands in the Jenkins pipeline.
   - **AWS Credentials Plugin**: For managing AWS credentials securely.
   - **GitHub Plugin**: For integrating Jenkins with GitHub.

### 2. **Terraform State Management**
   - **S3 Backend**: Use an S3 bucket to store your Terraform state files securely. Ensure your Jenkins pipeline has access to this bucket.
   - **DynamoDB for Locking**: Use DynamoDB to manage state locking and prevent concurrent modifications.

## 💡 Best Practices
- **Pipeline as Code**: Keep your `Jenkinsfile` in the repository for version control.
- **Use Workspaces**: Ensure each pipeline stage runs in a clean workspace to avoid conflicts.
- **Security**: Keep AWS credentials and sensitive data secure using Jenkins credentials management.
